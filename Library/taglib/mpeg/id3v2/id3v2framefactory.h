     * This factory abstracts away the frame creation process and instantiates
     * the appropriate ID3v2::Frame subclasses based on the contents of the
     * data.
     *
     * Reimplementing this factory is the key to adding support for frame types
     * not directly supported by TagLib to your application.  To do so you would
     * subclass this factory reimplement createFrame().  Then by setting your
     * factory to be the default factory in ID3v2::Tag constructor or with
     * MPEG::File::setID3v2FrameFactory() you can implement behavior that will
     * allow for new ID3v2::Frame subclasses (also provided by you) to be used.
     *
     * This implements both <i>abstract factory</i> and <i>singleton</i> patterns
     * of which more information is available on the web and in software design
     * textbooks (Notably <i>Design Patters</i>).
     *
     * \note You do not need to use this factory to create new frames to add to
     * an ID3v2::Tag.  You can instantiate frame subclasses directly (with new)
     * and add them to a tag using ID3v2::Tag::addFrame()
